StringCalculator Is a console application that calculates the sum of numbers, removing delimeters and throwing exception when numbers are negative.


I spent about 3â€“4 hours on this project. I first implemented the Add method to handle the basics like empty string, multiple numbers, newlines, then multiple delimiters. After that, I wrote some unit tests to verify if everything works correctly.
